a) I started experiencing with different hashes with the command echo -n "hello asdf"|sha256sum to get different kind of hashes. I noticed that the longer the hash then it was easier to get a hash that starts with a zero.

b) I started by creating a new text file called sami.txt and edited the text file with a text content of gg2 and it resulted a hash that started with 1e2e and then I changed the text content to gg and the hash chnged to 4960.

c) I have installed Hashcat in Debian with the command sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

d) Tried to crack the hash 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3, but Debian gives an error "attention no opencl hip or cuda compatible platform found".
   I did not want to give up with Hascat so I figoured out how to use Hashcat on Windows using a YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRUiRz_znLQ and managed to crack the hash with the result of: 123456 -> tylerandanya

e) To protect yourself from someone craking your password using a dictionary attacks you need to start using more difficoult passwords with atleast +12 letters combined with big and small letters, numbers and special characters. One good way is to start using password managing tools if you don't want to remember long passwords.
