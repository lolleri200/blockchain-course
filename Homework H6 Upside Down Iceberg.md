x) Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router:
    - Tor is know to:
      - To be an anonymity network designed to protect people's own privacy by preventing the attackers from linking communications or identifying users. The development is prioritized in the following farctors:
      1. Deployability: Tor must be practical in the real world, requiring minimal resources (e.g., bandwidth), not imposing heavy liabilities on the operators, and avoiding complex implementations or external software dependencies. It will also avoid requiring 
         non-anonymous users (e.g., websites) to run Tor so no one can access the Tor only websites.
      2. Usability: A user-friendly design is critical for wide adoption, as more users improve anonymity. Tor is designed to work with existing applications, minimizing delays and configuration steps. It is compatible with common
         operating systems, for example: Windows, Linux and MacOS.
      3. Flexibility: Tor's protocol is designed to be flexible and research-friendly, allowing for future improvements and experimentation without reinventing the whole system.
      4. Simple Design: Tor focuses on a simple, well-understood design, avoiding unnecessary complexities. It incorporates well-accepted techniques for anonymity without introducing unproven features that could complicate it's security.
