a) I have used a public key in my daily life when messaging with friends. I have today done public key excercises in using Tero's tutorial about sending encrypted and signed messages https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/ 
   Diffent systems such as SSH use the keys by authenticating the key found in a directory specified in a known location. (Basic overview of SSH Keys. 2019)

b) Created an encrypted message, but decrypting it was not succesful. Documented the process here: https://imgur.com/a/guYWXOB

c) Used  Winrar to encrypt a message file in a encrypted RAR file using a password. I think Winrar security is a  secure way of encrypting the users files.

d) The PGP message protection for Eve and Mallory's messaging is protected using private-key and public-key cryptography, as well as symmetric and asymmetric keys. (PGP Encryption. 2023)

e) The usage of password managers is recomended. I have started using KeePass and it required me to create a Master Password that contains all of my stored passwords. Hackers can target people that arent using password managers easily with automated tools. 
   It only takes a few seconds to crack an 11-character long password that is made up with only numbers.If the password is more complex and contains numbers, symbols and ppercase and lowercase letters it takes about 400 years to crack a complex password.
