x) My summary about: The importance of asset visibility in the detection and remediation of vulnerabilities

  - The article emphasizes the ongoing risks of undetected vulnerabilities, such as Log4j, despite public warnings and patches. It stresses the importance of comprehensive vulnerability management, including using diverse scanning tools, updating vendor signatures
    promptly, and ensuring mobile devices and hardware are included in malware scanning. Relying on software-focused scans can lead to missed vulnerabilities, particularly in complex systems. People should be scanning more than just monthly because it, is essential
    to maintain effective cyber security practises and reduce risks from unpatched vulnerabilities.
  
  - The Log4j vulnerability continues to be exploited even tho it has already been patched 18 times. The article also highlights the importance of discovering, mitigating, and fixing vulnerabilities as soon as possible. Storage and backup software can present easy breaches
    for attackers. A single, regular scan from one tool is a good place to start, but vendor focus can cause scans to target too narrow an area, leading to holes in inventorying and a lack of awareness of potential threats. Understanding diverse areas such as
    physics, electronics, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi may be required to inventory and assess all possible risks. Too specialized views of the enterprise leads to lower asset visibility and heightens risk as some vulnerabilities may be missed. To implement the CISA
    directive, organizations should update vendor signatures, including mobile devices, deploy multiple scanners and scanning types, and ensure hardware and infrastructure elements are inventoried and assessed. And also the scans should be performed on an ongoing basis.
